 ### bugs along the way
 3 radio button were allowing all to be checked. Solution was they needed the same name value.
 background image on sign up page was blurry. solution was to find a higher quality image.
 - When resizing the screen to mobile the Nav menu would dissapear. Solution was the class wasn't identified correctly in @media screen

 Sign up form just reloads page, tried to work out how to get it to open a specific page but was unsuccessful.
