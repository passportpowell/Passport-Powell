 ## Bugs along the way

 - 3 radio button were allowing all to be checked. Solution was they needed the same name value.
 background image on sign up page was blurry. solution was to find a higher quality image.

 - When resizing the screen to mobile the Nav menu would dissapear. Solution was the class wasn't identified correctly in @media screen

 - Sign up form just reloads page, tried to work out how to get it to open a specific page but was unsuccessful.


## Deployment

Deployment was achieved via GitHub and gitpod pages using the following steps

## Github
 - In the GitHub repository go to the Settings tab,

 - using the source section drop-down menu, select the Master/ or Main Branch,

 - Once completed a link will be provided that may take a few minutes to go live,

 - live link https://passportpowell.github.io/Passport-Powell/ .

## gitpod
 in the terminal type python3 -m http.server
 a pop up appears which upon clicking "open in browserW will show a new tab with the site created.
